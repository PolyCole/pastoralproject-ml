Often
I
Am
Permitted
To
Return
To
A
Meadow
Is
A
Short-form
Poem
Written
In
I
Hadn't
Ever
Heard
Of
And
So
I
Looked
Into
Him
A
Little
More
Closely
Before
Reading
His
Piece
And
Found
Out
He
Actually
Had
A
Pretty
Interesting
Early
Life
During
His
Childhood's
Parents
Held
A
Few
Occultist
Beliefs
And
Were
Avid
Practitioners
Of
The
Religion
This
Occultist
Religion
Is
Summarized
By
A
Set
Of
Religious
Masters
Who
Wrote
Spiritual
Texts
Containing
The
Secrets
To
Everything
From
Eternal
Life
To
Paranormal
Power
Centuries
Ago
Believe
That
They
Are
A
Group
Chosen
To
Be
The
Apprentices
Of
These
Early
Figures
And
Are
Destined
To
Learn
What
They
Learned
In
Addition
To
This
Was
Also
A
Prominent
Figure
In
Culture
In
The
United
States
Came
Out
In

A
Time
Period
Which
Was
Not
Exactly
Tolerant
Of
Produced
One
Of
His
Most
Renowned
Essays
Titled
The
In
Society
In
Wherein
He
Compared
The
Oppression
That
In
The
United
States
Were
Facing
With
What
African
Americans
Or
Followers
Of
Judaism
Had
Been
Facing
For
Years
I
Know
It's
Not
Entirely
Relevant
But
Learning
More
About
The
Background
Of
Helped
Me
Get
A
Better
Understanding
Of
The
Ideas
And
Opinions
He
Was
Bringing
To
The
Table
When
Writing
After
Reading
The
Poem
One
Of
The
Clearest
Things
I
Felt
As
I
Was
Reading
Through
This
Piece
Was
The
Sense
Of
Calm
That
Attaches
To
His
Metaphorical
Meadow
Listening
To
Him
Describe
It
In
The
Sixth
Stanza
The
Meadow's
Blowing
Grass
In
The
Hour
Before
The
Sun's
Going
Down
Made
For
An
Incredibly
Tranquil
Mental
Image
Clearly
Is
Referencing
A
Metaphorical
Pastoral
Paradise
Where
His
Mind
Can
Escape's
Use
Of
Permitted
Is
Something
That
Kind
Of
Clicked
With
Me
I
Know
That
In
The
Past
When
I've
Planned
Trips
Into
The
Woods
On
Backpacking
Trips
Expeditions
Or
Canoeing
Trips
I've
Had
To
Rely
On
A
Fair
Dollop
Of
Permission
Permission
From
My
Work
And
School
Schedule
To
Take
A
Few
Days
Off
To
Gallivant
Around
The
Pastoral
Permission
From
My
Wallet
To
Incur
The
Expenses
That
Come
With
These
Trips
And
Even
Permission
In
A
Literal
Sense
As
With
Some
Of
My
Longer
Trips
I've
Needed
To
Acquire
A
Physical
Permit
In
The
End
It's
Always
Worth
It
As
You
Inevitably
Come
Across
The
Scenes
That
Describes
As
As
If
It
Were
A
Scene
Made-up
By
The
Mind
Thankfully
Once
You've
Experienced
These
All
Too
Rare
Occasions
You
Have
The
Memory
To
Carry
With
You
And
Treasure
When
You're
In
Settings
That
Don't
Grant
You
Permission
To
Return
To
The
Pastoral
You
Have
As
Describes
The
Eternal
Pasture
Folded
In
All
Thought
This
Was
Another
Central
Idea
In
The
Piece
That
Closely
Resonated
With
Me
In
My
Day
To
Day
Life
I
Use
These
Cached
Images
Of
The
Pastoral
As
A
Form
Of
Stress
Relief
And
Whenever
I
Feel
Overwhelmed
I
Can
Escape
To
The
Mental
Pastoral
Even
If
My
Corporeal
Form
Never
Moves
This
Banked
Image
Is
One
Of
The
Items
Gained
During
The
Pastoral
Retreat
And
Return
Because
While
You
May
Need
Permission
To
Escape
To
The
Physical
Pastoral
You
Don't
Ever
Need
Permission
To
Escape
To
Your
Mental
Re-creation
Of
The
Pastoral
In
The
Spirit
Of
Transparency
I
Can
Say
That
I
Am
Not
Always
Engrossed
By
The
Books
Assigned
During
Classes
And
Too
Many
Times
Throughout
My
Educational
Career
Have
I
Been
Assigned
An
Absolutely
Dreadful
Read
That
I
Get
To
Trudge
Through
Thankfully
This
Has
Not
Been
My
Experience
With
Do
Androids
Dream
Of
Electric
Sheep
This
Novel
Has
Held
Me
Quite
Firmly
Since
I
Began
It
And
I
Think
That
Can
Largely
Be
Explained
By
Its
Almost
Prophetic
Relevancy
To
What
The
World
Looks
Like
Today
Within
The
First
Pages
The
Reader
Is
Acutely
Aware
Of
The
Complex
Relationship
Present
In
The
Novel
Between
The
Few
Humans
Left
On
Earth
Including
The
Bounty
Hunter
And
Animals
Explores
In
Depth
The
Senses
Of
Shame
He
Feels
From
Owning
An
Electric
Sheep
As
It
Is
Seen
In
Sharp
Contrast
With
The
Socially
Mandated
Responsibility
Of
Owning
And
Caring
For
An
Animal
Any
One
Will
Do
Ironically
Despite
The
Fact
That
This
Book
Is
In
Fact
Dystopian
The
Stance
That
The
Society
In
The
Novel
Takes
Regarding
The
Sanctity
Of
Life
Is
Thrown
Into
Sharp
Contrast
When
Considering
The
Current
State
Of
The
Real
World
As
Highlighted
By
The
Article
Published
In
New
Scientist
Humans
In
The
Real
World
Aren't
Nearly
As
Attentive
To
The
Upkeep
And
Care
For
The
Animals
That
Surround
Us
As
The
Article
Points
Out
In
A
Particularly
Stomach
Wrenching
Comment
Let
Us
Be
Clear
This
Is
Catastrophic
The
Article
Alludes
To
The
Fact
That
These
Declines
Cannot
Continue
On
Their
Current
Path
Lest
We
Risk
Losing
Large
Portions
Of
The
Biodiversity
Around
Us
It
Almost
Feels
When
Reading
The
Article
And
Considering
The
World
Of
Do
Androids
Dream
Of
Electric
Sheep
That
We're
Looking
At
A
Possible
Future
The
Article
Even
Helps
Establish
This
Connection
Highlighting
In
Big
Red
Letters
These
Declines
Are
Not
Written
In
Stone
We
Can
Turn
Them
Around
If
We
Choose
To
Alternatively
When
We
Observe
The
Work
Of
We
See
A
Completely
Opposite
View
Of
Nature
As
A
Whole
Throughout
His
Piece
Analyzes
The
Works
Of
Several
Authors
All
With
The
Central
Theme
Of
Pastoral
Settings
Being
A
Fundamental
Ingredient
In
Utopia
The
Pieces
That
Analyzes
Show
A
Possible
Alternative
To
The
Scenario
Described
In
Do
Androids
Dream
Of
Electric
Sheep
While
Notes
These
Utopias
Centered
Around
Pastoral
Spaces
He's
Also
Cautious
About
Them
He
Mentions
The
Potentially
Disastrous
Implications
On
Society
That
One
Author's
Utopian
Vision
Could
Have
Wherein
All
The
Factories
Are
Dismantled
These
Three
Works
Can
Connect
Together
To
Help
Illustrate
A
Rather
Clear
Message
Work
The
New
Scientist
Article
And
Do
Androids
Dream
Of
Electric
Sheep
All
Fit
Together
To
Form
An
Almost
Prophetic
Rendering
Of
What
Is
To
Come
Should
We
Forget
To
Sanctify
Nature
They
Highlight
The
Ways
In
Which
The
World
Can
Be
Thrown
Into
Irreparable
Disarray
Following
The
Widespread
Death
Of
Numerous
Species
Serves
To
Remind
Us
That
This
Isn't
A
Cut
And
Dry
Binary
Nature
Or
Progress
Technology
Or
Pastoral
But
Instead
A
Spectrum
The
Works
Analyzes
Show
That
With
Some
Careful
Consideration
And
Action
We
Can
Move
Away
From
The
Reality
Outlines
And
Into
Hopefully
One
Closer
To
The
Utopias
Explores
One
Of
The
Things
That
I
Found
Most
Fascinating
Through
Our
Examination
Of
The
Tyger
And
The
Lamb
Was
Highlighted
To
Me
When
We
Began
Talking
About
Which
Of
The
Poems
Our
Class
Preferred
Almost
Unanimously
Our
Class
Agreed
That
We
Found
The
Tyger
More
Interesting
Or
Perhaps
More
Captivating
Than
The
Lamb
When
Reflecting
On
This
Observation
I
Realized
That
There
Must
Be
Something
Inherent
In
Human
Nature
To
Revere
Things
That
Are
Wild
And
That
Slightly
Scare
Us
Subsequently
There
Must
Be
Some
Strange
Beauty
That
We
Find
In
Them
That
Keeps
Us
Hooked
I
Imagine
That
Sailors
Crossing
The
Atlantic
Ocean
Feel
The
Same
Way
As
We
Did
When
Reading
The
Poem
Albeit
In
A
More
Distilled
Sense
They're
Simultaneously
Awed
And
Terrified
By
The
Sea
But
Somehow
The
Savagery
Of
It
Makes
It
Even
More
Beautiful
The
Tyger
Created
A
Similar
Feeling
For
Me
When
We
Read
It
In
Class
Lines
Like
What
The
Hammer
What
The
Chain
In
What
Furnace
Was
Thy
Brain
Create
This
Exact
Feeling
And
Keep
Us
Coming
Back
To
The
Poem
For
That
Sense
Of
Morbid
Fascination
The
Second
Poem
The
Lamb
Was
Certainly
About
A
More
Calming
Subject
Matter
But
Didn't
Have
The
Same
Grasp
That
The
Tyger
Did
Simply
Because
We
Weren't
Drawn
By
That
Inherent
Captivation
Of
Things
That
Scare
Us
Similarly
I
Think
This
Portion
Of
The
Human
Condition
Can
Largely
Be
Observed
In
Our
News
Media
Turning
On
The
Evening
News
On
Any
Given
Night
Will
Show
That
Almost
Of
News
Coverage
Is
Spent
On
Horrible
Mishaps
Arguments
Or
Terrible
Events
Happening
In
The
World
Whether
It's
The
Surge
Of
The
Pandemic
The
Explosion
In
Or
A
Car
Pileup
On
The
Nearest
Highway
News
Networks
Have
Picked
Up
On
This
Same
Inherent
Tendency
Of
Human
Beings
We
Become
Engrossed
By
Things
That
Sicken
Terrify
Us
And
Those
Are
The
Things
That
Keep
Us
Watching
Of
Course
Every
News
Outlet
Will
End
With
A
Few
Feel
Good
Pieces
So
That
We
Think
That
There
Are
Still
Some
Lamb's
Left
In
The
World
And
It
Isn't
Just
All
Tygers
However
The
Overwhelming
Amount
Of
News
Coverage
Is
Reserved
For
Terrible
Events
This
Was
The
Idea
That
I
Found
Most
From
William
Blake's
The
Tyger
And
The
Lamb
The
Ability
It
Has
To
Highlight
Our
Innate
And
Slightly
Morbid
Fascination
With
Things
That
Scare
Us
In
Pastoral
And
Do
Androids
Dream
Of
Electric
Sheep
We
See
A
Juxtaposition
Between
Two
Types
Of
Futures
In
Pastoral
We
Note
The
Existence
Of
A
Dream
Like
Future
In
News
From
Nowhere
One
Where
The
Industrial
Revolution
Is
Reversed
And
The
Boundary
Between
Nature
And
Man
Is
Destroyed
Nature
As
People
Used
To
Call
It
As
One
Thing
And
Mankind
As
Another
Speaks
Of
People
Living
A
Life
Not
Only
In
Harmony
With
Nature
But
One
Which
Fulfills
The
Natural
In
Themselves
As
Much
As
Speaks
Of
The
Merging
Of
Mankind
And
Nature
Speaks
Rather
Of
Their
Dissonance
Mankind
Has
Caused
Such
Destruction
To
The
Natural
World
That
Almost
All
Animals
Cease
To
Exist
This
Is
Reminiscent
Of
The
Article
Which
Details
The
Rapid
Decline
Of
Certain
Species
Populations
We
Also
See
The
Presence
Of
Androids
Machines
Even
Further
From
Nature
Than
Mankind
Has
Become
One
Thing
I
Find
Particularly
Interesting
In
The
First
Few
Chapters
Of
Novel
Is
The
Distinction
Between
Humans
And
Androids
The
Binary
As
We
Have
Been
Discussing
You
Are
Either
One
Or
The
Other
The
Humans
Have
Built
Numerous
Machines
Which
Aim
To
Detect
Whether
Someone
Is
Human
Or
Android
The
Current
Model
Is
Based
On
An
Empathy
Test
But
We
See
That
The
Test
Is
Not
Very
Reliable
It
Can
Misdiagnose
People
With
Special
Circumstances
I
Think
This
Brings
Up
Two
Important
Points
What
Is
It
That
Makes
Us
Human
Rather
Than
Android
Is
It
Empathy
Because
If
It
Were
Then
The
Machine
Would
Never
Fail
And
The
Boundary
Between
Living
And
Android
Seems
To
Be
Very
Blurred
On
One
Hand
They
Have
The
Failings
Of
The
Human
Tests
But
Also
We
See
The
Creation
Of
The
Electric
Animals
As
A
Substitute
For
A
Real
Animal
It
Seems
Too
That
Even
In
This
Futuristic
World
Which
Isn't
So
Futuristic
Anymore
The
Year
Is
In
The
Book
As
Far
As
I
Recall
There
Is
Still
Some
Element
Of
Social
Hierarchy
And
Desire
To
Fit
In
With
The
Rest
Of
Society
That
Warrants
Caring
For
A
Machine
As
If
It
Were
An
Animal
And
Disguising
The
Workshop
Where
It
Is
Repaired
As
An
Animal
Care
Facility
I
Suppose
This
Writing
Piece
Was
A
Very
Messy
Way
Of
Saying
That
I
Think
Work
Are
In
Sharp
Contrast
With
One
Another
And
Also
That
Work
Blurs
The
Lines
Between
Human
And
Machinery
It
Makes
Me
Wonder
Whether
We
Will
Reach
Such
A
Point
In
The
Near
Future
Where
We
Will
Become
Either
Reliant
On
Machinery
Or
Metaphorically
Invaded
By
Androids
In
That
Our
World
Will
Become
So
Mechanised
So
Industrialised
That
Mankind
Will
Be
Indistinguishable
From
The
Machinery
And
Inanimate
Objects
That
We
Have
Produced
I
First
Want
To
Look
At
The
World
Permitted
As
Uses
In
His
Title
Often
I
Am
Permitted
To
Return
To
A
Meadow
The
Word
Itself
Is
Quite
Humble
In
My
Opinion
As
If
Was
Only
Allowed
To
Return
By
Some
Higher
Power
Or
Other
Force
He
Had
To
Have
Permission
The
Term
Meadow
Means
A
Protected
Secluded
Area
Of
Some
Kind
Some
Grass
Trees
And
Flowers
Possibly
Cut
Off
From
The
Rest
Of
The
World
A
Sort
Of
Haven
Amidst
Other
Things
Whether
It
Be
A
Forest
Or
Even
An
Urban
Setting
The
Meadow
That
Talks
About
While
Is
Metaphorical
I
Think
Could
Also
Possibly
Speak
Also
To
Our
Physical
Retreat
And
Return
Pastoral
Concept
In
That
We
Occasionally
Venture
Out
To
The
Natural
Land
Whether
It
Be
For
A
Hike
Or
On
Holiday
But
We
Must
Always
Return
To
Our
Life
In
The
City
Or
A
More
Urban
Area
We
Repeat
This
Process
Switching
Between
These
Two
Binaries
I
Would
Argue
Though
That
In
The
Metaphorical
Sense
This
Meadow
Is
Sort
Of
An
Idyllic
Place
In's
Mind
Reminiscent
Of
A
Sort
Of
Heaven
The
Fact
That
It
Is
An
Eternal
Pasture
Also
Speaks
To
The
Heavenly
Notion
Of
This
Space
It
Endures
Both
Space
And
Time
The
Fact
That
This
Place
Is
One
Of
Light
Where
The
Shadows
That
Are
Forms
Fall
Speaks
Also
To
This
Idyllic
Heavenly
Nature
Of
This
Space
It
Is
Comprised
Only
Of
Good
Things
And
Not
Bad
Things
Or
At
Least
If
There
Are
Bad
Things
We
Are
Unaffected
By
Them
We
Can
See
Past
Them
Here
We
See
Another
Example
Of
A
Binary
In
The
Pastoral
Sense
The
Binary
Of
Good
And
Bad
Is
Able
To
Escape
The
Bad
And
Enter
The
Meadow
The
Good
As
A
Sort
Of
Retreat
I
Think
The
Meadow
Is
Ultimately
A
Metaphor
For
Peace
Of
Mind
So
Often
We
Are
Consumed
By
Our
Daily
Stressors
And
The
Bad
Things
That
Happen
To
Us
And
Every
Once
In
A
While
We
Find
Ourselves
At
Peace
With
Reality
We
Must
Be
Given
Permission
To
Enter
This
Peaceful
State
And
I
Would
Argue
That
Sometimes
We
Must
Give
Ourselves
This
Permission
By
Not
Worrying
About
Things
We
Cannot
Change
Creating
These
Certain
Bounds
Which
Hold
Against
Chaos
I
Think
The
Last
Line
Which
Describes
The
Meadow
As
An
Everlasting
Omen
Of
What
Is
Points
To
The
Fact
That
We
Can
Only
See
Things
Clearly
Once
We
Obtain
This
Peaceful
Mindset
Once
We
Give
Ourselves
Permission
To
Leave
The
Clutches
Of
Our
Stressors
And
Retreat
To
The
Meadow
I
Also
Think
It
Is
Worth
Noting
That
It
Is
A
Meadow
And
Not
The
Meadow
Implying
That
Perhaps
The
Meadow
Is
Unique
To
The
Situation
Or
Even
The
Individual
I
Think
That
The
Use
Of
A
Points
To
The
Fact
That
All
Of
Us
Can
Construct
Our
Own
Situation-evolving
Meadow
As
A
Given
Property
Of
The
Mind
A
Place
Where
We
May
Retreat
To
Gather
Perspective
And
Regain
Mental
Strength
For
My
Final
Project
In
Honors
Literary
Inquiry
The
Pastoral
We
Were
Tasked
With
Creating
Some
Sort
Of
Project
Roughly
Equivalent
To
A
Page
Term
Paper
All
Quarter
We
Had
Been
Discussing
Different
Pastoral
Elements
Found
In
Literature
Through
Various
Poems
Books
And
Videos
In
One
Of
The
Novels
We
Read
Do
Androids
Dream
Of
Electric
Sheep
By
There
Was
A
Moment
When
One
Of
The
Characters
Begins
To
Theorize
About
How
A
Certain
Talkshow
Host
Named
Has
The
Time
To
Produce
The
Content
Displayed
During
His
Audio
And
Video
Show
The
Answer
To
Any
Human
Reading
The
Novel
Is
That
Is
An
Android
Tasked
Solely
With
Generating
Content
To
Put
On
Air
During
His
Show
This
Section
Got
Me
Wondering
Is
It
Possible
To
Have
A
Computer
Generate
Content
With
Some
Of
The
Pastoral
Elements
We've
Discussed
In
Class
Using
Today's
Technology
So
I
Got
To
Researching
I
Found
A
Tutorial
On
Website
About
Generating
Text
Using
A
And
Began
My
Proceedings
There
Thanks
To
A
Dataset
I
Found
On
I
Had
Access
To
Of
Poetry
From
The
Poetry
Foundation's
Website
Which
Would
Serve
As
The
Training
Set
For
My
Mode
I
Also
Spiced
It
Up
By
Adding
The
Works
Of
A
Few
Of
The
Authors
We
Talked
About
In
Class
After
Training
The
Model
I
Could
Begin
